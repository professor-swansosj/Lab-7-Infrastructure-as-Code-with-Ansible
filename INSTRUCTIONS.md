# Instructions â€” Lab 7 â€” Infrastructure as Code with Ansible

## Objectives
- Create and configure Ansible inventories for network devices.
- Test connectivity and gather facts from Cisco devices (DevNet Always-On).
- Organize data with host_vars and group_vars for clean variable scope.
- Author Jinja2 templates to generate VLAN and loopback configs.
- Build playbooks to configure VLANs and loopbacks from structured data.
- Implement a backup playbook that saves device configurations locally.
- Apply Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles for scalable network automation.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.11 (via the provided dev container)
- Accounts: GitHub
- Devices/Sandboxes: Cisco DevNet Always-On Sandbox â€” Catalyst 8k or 9k (SSH/NETCONF)

## Overview
Move from script-based automation to **Infrastructure as Code** with Ansible. Youâ€™ll define a project with inventories, variables, templates, and playbooks; connect to a DevNet sandbox device; deploy VLANs and loopbacks via Jinja2; and implement a timestamped backup workflow. The result is idempotent, version-controlled automation you can scale and reuse.


> **Before you begin:** Open the dev container; verify Ansible and Python are available. Create the folders `logs/`, `backups/`, `templates/`, `group_vars/`, `host_vars/`, `playbooks/`, and `configs/` if missing.


## Resources
- [Ansible Documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/)- [Ansible Galaxy â€” cisco.ios](https://galaxy.ansible.com/cisco/ios)- [Jinja2 Templates](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/)- [YAML Syntax (YAML.org)](https://yaml.org/spec/)- [Cisco DevNet Sandboxes](https://developer.cisco.com/site/sandbox/)
## Deliverables
- Standardized README with objectives, overview, grading, and tips.
- Stepwise INSTRUCTIONS for inventory, templates, playbooks, backups, and logs.
- Grading: **100 points**

Follow these steps in order.

> **Logging Requirement:** Write progress to `logs/*.log` as you complete each step.

## Step 1 â€” Clone repository and setup
**Goal:** Get the lab locally and initialize logs.

**What to do:**  
Clone your Classroom repo and change into it. Ensure `logs/` exists and write an initial
`LAB7_START` line into `logs/setup.log`.


**Youâ€™re done when:**  
- You are in the repo root.
- `logs/setup.log` contains `LAB7_START`.


**Log marker to add:**  
`[LAB7_START]`

## Step 2 â€” Open dev container and verify
**Goal:** Use the standardized environment with Ansible and collections.

**What to do:**  
Reopen in container. Verify Ansible version (2.14+), confirm `cisco.ios` is installed,
and log a `DEVCONTAINER_READY` line with version info to `logs/setup.log`.


**Youâ€™re done when:**  
- Ansible version prints successfully.
- `logs/setup.log` shows `DEVCONTAINER_READY ...`.


**Log marker to add:**  
`[DEVCONTAINER_READY]`

## Step 3 â€” Create inventory and ansible.cfg
**Goal:** Target the DevNet sandbox device.

**What to do:**  
Create `ansible.cfg` with local inventory path, disabled host key checking, and YAML callback.
Create `inventory.yml` with a `routers` group and `router1` host using sandbox details.
Run `ansible-inventory --list` and a simple `ansible all -m ping`.


**Youâ€™re done when:**  
- Inventory lists hosts.
- Ping succeeds to router1.
- `logs/ansible_test.log` records `INVENTORY_CREATED`.


**Log marker to add:**  
`[INVENTORY_CREATED]`

## Step 4 â€” Connectivity test and facts
**Goal:** Validate access and capture device facts.

**What to do:**  
Author `playbooks/test_connectivity.yml` to ping and gather facts using `cisco.ios.ios_facts`,
then append a `CONNECTIVITY_TEST` line to `logs/ansible_test.log`.


**Youâ€™re done when:**  
- Playbook finishes successfully and prints model/version.
- Log shows `CONNECTIVITY_TEST` entries.


**Log marker to add:**  
`[CONNECTIVITY_TEST]`

## Step 5 â€” Variable structure (group_vars and host_vars)
**Goal:** Centralize shared data and per-host overrides.

**What to do:**  
Create `group_vars/all.yml` and `group_vars/routers.yml` for global and router-group data
(e.g., DNS/NTP, default VLANs, standard loopbacks). Create `host_vars/router1.yml` for
device-specific loopbacks and VLANs. Verify access with `ansible-inventory --host router1`.


**Youâ€™re done when:**  
- Files exist with valid YAML.
- `logs/ansible_test.log` has `VARIABLES_CREATED`.


**Log marker to add:**  
`[VARIABLES_CREATED]`

## Step 6 â€” Jinja2 templates
**Goal:** Generate VLAN and loopback configs from variables.

**What to do:**  
Create `templates/vlans.j2` and `templates/loopbacks.j2`. Dry-run render via a small test
play to write outputs under `./configs/`.


**Youâ€™re done when:**  
- Both templates render.
- Generated files contain data from group and host vars.


**Log marker to add:**  
`[TEMPLATES_OK]`

## Step 7 â€” Deploy VLAN configuration
**Goal:** Apply VLANs and verify on device.

**What to do:**  
Create `playbooks/configure_vlans.yml` to render template to `configs/` and apply with
`cisco.ios.ios_config`. Verify via `show vlan brief` and log `VLAN_DEPLOYED`.


**Youâ€™re done when:**  
- VLANs appear on device.
- `logs/vlan_deployment.log` shows `VLAN_DEPLOYED`.


**Log marker to add:**  
`[VLAN_DEPLOYED]`

## Step 8 â€” Deploy loopback interfaces
**Goal:** Apply loopbacks and verify.

**What to do:**  
Create `playbooks/configure_loopbacks.yml` to render and apply Loopback interfaces, verify
with `show ip interface brief | include Loopback`, and log `LOOPBACK_DEPLOYED`.


**Youâ€™re done when:**  
- Loopbacks appear on device.
- `logs/loopback_deployment.log` shows `LOOPBACK_DEPLOYED`.


**Log marker to add:**  
`[LOOPBACK_DEPLOYED]`

## Step 9 â€” Backup device configuration
**Goal:** Save timestamped running config and summarize.

**What to do:**  
Create `playbooks/backup_config.yml` to write device backups into `backups/` with a timestamp
and update `backups/backup_log.txt`. Log `BACKUP_CREATED` to `logs/backup_operations.log`.


**Youâ€™re done when:**  
- Backup files exist with timestamps.
- `backup_log.txt` updated.
- `logs/backup_operations.log` shows `BACKUP_CREATED`.


**Log marker to add:**  
`[BACKUP_CREATED]`

## Step 10 â€” Master run and submit
**Goal:** Execute end-to-end and finalize.

**What to do:**  
Create `playbooks/deploy_all.yml` that imports the other playbooks. Run it, confirm device
state matches rendered configs, and add a final `LAB7_COMPLETE` line with counts.
Commit all files, push, and open a PR to `main`.


**Youâ€™re done when:**  
- All playbooks execute without errors.
- Required artifacts and logs exist.
- PR opens and Verify Docs is green.


**Log marker to add:**  
`[LAB7_COMPLETE]`


## FAQ
**Q:** Playbook fails with unreachable or SSH auth errors.  
**A:** Verify inventory credentials, test manual SSH first, and set host_key_checking False in ansible.cfg.

**Q:** YAML parsing errors on playbooks or vars.  
**A:** Use spaces (not tabs), quote strings with colons, and run `yamllint` locally.

**Q:** Templates render but variables are empty.  
**A:** Check variable scope and names; test with `ansible-inventory --host <name>` and `debug` tasks.

**Q:** Module `cisco.ios.ios_config` not found.  
**A:** Install the collection: `ansible-galaxy collection install cisco.ios` and verify with `ansible-galaxy collection list`.


## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting & Pro Tips
**Inventory sanity**  
*Symptom:* Ping fails to all hosts  
*Fix:* Run `ansible-inventory --list` and confirm `ansible_host`, user, and connection vars.

**Template paths**  
*Symptom:* template not found  
*Fix:* Use paths relative to the playbook (`../templates/*.j2`) or set `template` task paths carefully.

**Privilege issues**  
*Symptom:* Auth failed when applying configs  
*Fix:* Ensure device user has privileges; set `ansible_become: yes` if needed.
